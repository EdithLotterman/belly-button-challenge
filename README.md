# belly-button-challenge

#### The assignment was to build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. <br>
<br> The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

### Using the Dashboard<br>
#### Use the dropdown menu to select which sample id you wish to view. The Demogrpahic panel displays information about the sample, the bar chart dhows the top ten most common bacteria in that sample, and the bubble chart gives a visual representation of the prevalence all of the bateria species present,
